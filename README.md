# chantbot

chantbot is a bot that tweets at intervals from a corpus of texts.

## Roadmap

* Tweet at fixed intervals from text file broken up line by line
* auto-break lines that are over 140 characters
* cycle through multiple text files
* optional: use irregular intervals
* optional: shuffle vs. cycle in texts
* save state
* adapt for cron-job not just running process
* turn selected words into hashtags
* text pre-processing tools
